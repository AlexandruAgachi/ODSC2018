You will now have the same repository on your local machines. Next, we look at what to install to be able to run this notebook. 

We will use Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/), a popular framework for managing Python (and R!) packages. Please install Anaconda from their website. 


The instructions for installing the Anaconda environment for MAC and LINUX Users are all in one script. 
In your terminal please run: 
```sh create_ODSC_env.sh```

This will create a new Anaconda environment with (hopefully) all the Python and R packages needed.  After installing, the ODSC environment is already activate but you can also do it using the below commands.

To activate the environment you need to type: 
```source activate ODSC```

To deactivate the environment you need to type: 
```source deactivate ODSC```

For Windows users, please adapt the script to run on Windows.
