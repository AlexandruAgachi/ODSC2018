    "In most fields, missing data is so common that it is a given. You literally design your studies from the beginning with missing data in mind. The problem is particularly acute for surveys, longitudinal studies, and in clinical medicine.\n",

It is not uncommon for patients in the treatment arm to drop out due to adverse reactions to the treatment, or due to lack of improvement. In parallel, particularly healthy subjects, or ones who react exceptionally well to the treatment, will have very high completion rates for the study. The former, missing patients, will then become missing data in the final study. Ignoring them would lead to biased estimates of the efficacy of the treatment.

    "What is imputation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Imputation amounts to filling in missing values with appropriate estimates for them, and then using standard complete data methods to study the now complete dataset. “From an operational standpoint, imputation solves the missing-data problem at the outset, enabling the analyst to proceed without further hindrance.” (Schafer, 1999)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: It is important to understand from the beginning the objective of imputation. It is not to estimate as accurately as possible any single missing value. The objective is to create a complete dataset that preserves as much as possible the characteristics of the original complete dataset. Intuitively this makes sense because in applied statistics, we aim to infer parameters about a population, based on the estimates computed from our sample. As such we are interested in statistics about aggregates, rather than in the exact value of single observations. As Little and Rubin (2002) state “It is important to note at the outset that usually sample surveys are conducted with the goal of making inferences about population quantities such as means, correlations and regression coefficients, and the values of individual cases in the data set are not the main interest. Thus, the objective of imputation is not to get the best possible predictions of the missing values, but to replace them by plausible values in order to exploit the information in the recorded variables in the incomplete cases for inference about population parameters.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Cautionary note: there are many methods to impute missing data. You need to be careful to both use one of the statistically robust methods, and to use a software package that implements it correctly. The theory is very esoteric and there are many permutations possible in implementing it. Choose mainstream multiple imputation methods and mainstream packages, per our recommendations at the end of this tutorial."

    "### Single imputation\n",
    "As seen above already actually, in this \"technique,\" missing values are replaced with a single value derived from the non-missing values for each variable, for example the mean or mode of that variable in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is (unfortunately) the most recommended method of imputation, especially in data analysis world. It is also the only method provided by frameworks such as pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the problem with single imputation? You are obviously not changing the mean nor mode of your variables since you are using it to fill in the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variances and covariances will be severely underestimated (Haitovsky, 1968), for two reasons. First, filling in all missing values with the mean will not account for the variation that would most likely be present in reality between those observed values. You are imputing the mean for every missing value, while the real values would probably vary around the mean value. Second, your ultimately increased sample size will result in smaller standard errors, and these will not accurately reflect the uncertainty actually existing in your dataset due to those missing values. In studying single imputation methods, Pigott (2001) concludes that “under no circumstances does mean imputation produce unbiased results…Bias in the estimation of variances and standard errors are compounded when estimating multivariate parameters such as regression coefficients.”\n",
    "\n",
    "What about longitudinal studies and the common practice of LOCF (last observation carried forward) and BOCF (baseline observation carried forward)?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are simply specific cases of single imputation. As such, they do not take into account the information about the missing data contained in the observed data, they lead to biased estimates, and they underestimate the uncertainty contained in the dataset.\n",

    "**How many imputed datasets do you need?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Rubin originally suggested that only a couple of imputed datasets would be sufficient (1987), more recent research indicates that significantly more imputations are needed. The appropriate number depends on the proportion of observations with missing values in the dataset. If you have 50% missing values for some variables for example, you will be looking at 40 imputed datasets. A comprehensive study on the desirable number of imputation for different scenarios was published by Graham (2007). He recommends “that one should use m=20, 20, 40, 100, and >100 for true γ= 0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, and 0.90, respectively.” (m = number of imputed datasets needed and γ = percentage of observations with missing data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What variables should you include in your multiple imputation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "All of them. Rubin (1996) notes that the imputed dataset should include all the variables that will be used for subsequent analyses. This is one of the weaknesses of multiple imputation in practice: the person conducting the multiple imputation and generating the imputed datasets needs to be perfectly calibrated with the researchers conducting the analyses in terms of variables of interest. \n",
    "By the same logic, any interaction variables of interest also need to be included. If engineered variables are not included in the multiple imputation dataset, relationships that actually exist may not be found in subsequent analyses, as the imputations would have been generated with the assumption that those variables were independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Including the dependant variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, including that one. This is not only recommended, but essential. For a full reasoning of why, see Allison (2001), Moons, Donders, Stijnen and Harrell (2006) and Graham (2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Should you include any other variables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Collins et al. (2001) showed that you should include in your dataset, before imputation, not only the variables of interest but also all auxiliary variables. These are defined as variables that are not of direct interest in your study themselves, but which are correlated with the variables of interest in your study. Including them in your imputation approach was shown to reduce estimation bias, in particular as due to MNAR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have your healthy doubts about the MAR assumption in your dataset, should you still use these multiple imputation methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. They are as good as anything we have, including when the MAR assumption is tenuous (Graham, 2009). It is actually Collins et al. (2001) who showed that MNAR data will not affect in a material way the internal validity of a study by itself. In the medical context, Mallinckrodt et al (2008) and O’Kelly and Ratitch (2014) both reached the same conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Should you/can you include categorical variables in your model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes you should, and yes you can. However, pay attention here as different software implementations of the same algorithms require different preprocessing here (creating dummy variables or not, coding them as factors…).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does multiple imputation work for small datasets with many variables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graham & Schafer (1999) showed that “MI performs very well in small samples (as low as N = 50), even with very large multiple regression models (as large as 18 predictors) and even with as much as 50% missing data in the DV.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can you conduct exploratory analysis on a complete dataset given the time that implementing MI requires?**\n",
    "\n",
    "At this level Allison (2001) offers a simple and elegant solution. When you generate the x imputed datasets that you will use in your multiple imputation procedure, simply generate x+1 instead. Use the extra dataset to conduct your exploratory analysis and evaluation your intended models for analysis."

    "## Handling missing data: roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the amount of missing data per variable.\n",
    "This will tell you how large of a problem you have. In practical terms, it will also be an indication of how much effort you should expense on handling your missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visualize your dataset itself with regards to missing data within it, or generate plots of the missing data across your dataset to check for patterns. If your dataset is longitudinal, check if the missing data is monotone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In complement or replacement to 3, compute in tables the missingness of different variables versus other variables including the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. As a follow up to 3, run a logistic regression of missingness for each variable with missing data as the response variable (yes/no), and the other variables as the explanatory variables.\n",
    "Steps 3 and 4 will allow you to check if any variables are correlated with the missingness in your study, and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. As a result of 3, 4, your investigation of the missing data in this study, and especially your discussion with data collectors and domain experts, decide if you can assume that your data is missing completely at random (MNAR) or at least missing at random (MAR).\n",
    "If you believe your data is MNAR, you can use Little’s test to confirm this. If your data is MCAR you know that basic methods of handling your missing data such as complete case analysis and available case analysis, will possibly significantly reduce the power of your study, but will not necessarily bias your results.\n",
    "If you can make the MNAR or MAR assumption, then your missing data is ignorable and you can proceed in confidence with a suitable multiple imputation method and then your intended statistical analyses.\n",
    "If your data is not missing at random – in this case you will still proceed with the same multiple imputation tools and analyses as above, but you will know that your results may be severely biased. As such, you will not use your results without at the very least complementing them with a suitable sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Choose and run an appropriate multiple imputation procedure: maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, mice, hot deck or knn.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Decide the number m of multiply imputer datasets you will need, per Graham’s guidelines (2007, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Apply your analyses as you would with any other complete dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Pool your results following Rubin’s rules."
